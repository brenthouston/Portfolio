## General info
This is a Portfolio App that highlights my most recent projects. The App is responsive to the viewport it is being loaded on. It has a recent profile pic of me and 4 sections Navigation, Bio, My Work, Contact.  Navigation is a quick link to various locations in the page. Bio is about me. My work highlights recent work. When hoverin on a projects card the app presents it and I used clip-path to animate the hyperlinked cards that take you to the deployed app. Finally, contact has my contact info and a hyperlink to go to my github repository.
	
## Technologies

                I used Excalidraw to create the wireframe and a checklist to keep me on task.
